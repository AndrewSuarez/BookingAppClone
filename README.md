# Booking App Clone


## Frontend clone of Booking.com
This is a pure frontend clone demo of the Booking page built using ReactJS, some of its features are:

- Home page with some information of locations, property type and some sample hotels to book.
- Search bar for more specific information and sorting by rooms, location and date.
- More detailed page of booking places with more information per page and a more detaield search component.

## Notes 
This application is purely frontend, meaning most of the functionalities dont work since it needs to be connected to a backend server and database, which are still a work in progress. This was made following a Youtube Tutorial by Lama Dev.
